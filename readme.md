A collection of projects and labs from my CS journey at the Exact Sciences Department of the University of Buenos Aires (Linux purist institution)

Contains:

- Kernel/OS Development (e.g., x86 bare-metal programming, task scheduling)
- Algorithms & Data Structures (C++ implementations, competitive programming submissions)
- Systems Programming (Linux-centric: pipes, syscalls, threading)
- Misc. Scripts (Bash/Python utilities provided by Linux god Mega and other Comp Org and OS professors)
