A formal computational model of Argentina's electoral system, designed and developed for the Algorithms and Data Structures 2 course (2nd year CS).

Simulates electoral processes with strict adherence to:

- Constitutional rules (vote allocation, seat distribution)

- Algorithmic complexity requirements (professor-mandated bounds)

- Real-world constraints (e.g., D'Hondt method)

Requirements found in ``enunciado.pdf``
